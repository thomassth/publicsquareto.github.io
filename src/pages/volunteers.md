# Our Volunteers

## Powered by Community, Driven by Purpose

Public Square TO is an initiative brought to life by dedicated volunteers from the Civic Tech Toronto community who are passionate about enhancing democratic participation in our city.

### Our Connection to Civic Tech Toronto

While Public Square TO volunteers are active members of Civic Tech Toronto, we operate as an independent initiative. Civic Tech Toronto is a vibrant community where people use technology to make Toronto better, hosting weekly hack nights and various civic projects. Our volunteers drew inspiration from this community but created Public Square TO as a focused initiative specifically for democratic engagement.
