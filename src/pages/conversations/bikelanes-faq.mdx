<summary>Environment and Public Health</summary>
#### In Favor of Bike Lanes

Bike lanes encourage cycling, which can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality. They also promote physical activity, contributing to public health benefits.

<summary>Equity and Accessibility</summary>
#### In Favor of Bike Lanes

[Bike lanes can make cycling more accessible to a broader demographic](https://euc.yorku.ca/research-spotlight/why-bike-lanes-should-remain-on-ontarios-roads/), including women, children, older adults, and individuals with disabilities. They provide a safer and more inclusive transportation option for those who may not have access to cars.

#### Against Bike Lanes

Critics contend that bike lanes primarily benefit certain groups and may not address the transportation needs of all community members. There are concerns that resources allocated to bike lanes could be directed toward improving public transit or other services that serve a wider population.

<summary>Governance and Policy</summary>
#### In Favor of Bike Lanes

Proponents argue that decisions regarding bike lane implementation should be made at the municipal level, allowing for tailored solutions that reflect local needs and priorities. [They express concerns that provincial mandates, such as Ontario's Bill 212, may undermine local autonomy.](https://ycppl.info.yorku.ca/who-decides-where-bike-lanes-go-the-controversy-of-bill-212/)

#### Against Bike Lanes

Supporters of provincial oversight believe that a coordinated approach can ensure consistency and address broader transportation challenges. They argue that provincial involvement can help balance the interests of various stakeholders across different municipalities.
