# Our Technology Platform

## Empowering Democratic Dialogue with Pol.is

We use Pol.is, an innovative open-source platform that transforms how communities engage in meaningful discussions and find common ground on complex issues.

### What is Pol.is?

Pol.is is a real-time survey and conversation platform that uses AI to identify areas of consensus and disagreement within large groups. It has been used worldwide by governments, organizations, and communities to facilitate productive public dialogue.

### How It Works

Instead of traditional comments, participants respond to statements with agree/disagree/pass. Machine learning algorithms analyze these patterns to reveal where different groups share common ground, helping bridge divides and find constructive solutions.

### Why We Chose Pol.is

Pol.is stands out for its ability to:

- Scale conversations to thousands of participants
- Reduce toxicity in online discussions
- Identify areas of consensus across different groups
- Provide clear data visualization of community opinions

### Computational Democracy

Polis is the flagship technology of Computational Democracy, an organization dedicated to enhancing democratic participation through innovative digital tools. This open-source platform uses advanced data visualization and machine learning to highlight areas of consensus and disagreement, helping communities engage in more productive conversations. By allowing participants to see where their views align or differ from others, Polis exemplifies Computational Democracy's mission to transform collective decision-making. The organization continues to refine Polis while exploring new approaches to strengthen democratic processes.
